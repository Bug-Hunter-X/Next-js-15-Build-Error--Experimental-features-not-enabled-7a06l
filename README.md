This repository demonstrates a common build error in Next.js 15 applications related to the usage of experimental features.  The `bug.js` file contains the code that triggers the error.  The solution is provided in `bugSolution.js`.  The error occurs because experimental features require explicit enabling in `next.config.js`. This example shows how to correctly enable the necessary features to resolve the build error.
